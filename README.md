# Javascript-The-Basics
The purpose of this repository is purely code storage as I follow along and learn how to fully utilize Javascript in Web applications.  I decided to take this course to supplement the course I was following on Ruby on Rails and to expand my own skills. 

##Organization 
Each folder represents a section of the course with the files inside demonstrating what was covered in each section. 

##How are you running this outside of a web browser?
I wanted the ability to look back on my work.  Therefore, instead of working in the console, I am using Rhino and runing my javascript in terminal.
