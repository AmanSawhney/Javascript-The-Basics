# Javascript-The-Basics
The purpose of this repository is purely code storage as I follow along and learn how to fully utilize Javascript in Web applications.  I decided to take this course to supplement the course I was following on Ruby on Rails and to expand my own skills. 

##How are you running this outside of a web browser?
I wanted the ability to look back on my work, so instead of working in the console I am using Rhino and runing my javascript in terminal.
